    "summary": "Kaspa launched as a technical 'fair launch' with zero pre-mine, but the first 6 months reveal structural insider advantages that are impossible to audit. The period from Nov 7, 2021 to May 8, 2022 (pre-deflationary phase: 500 KAS/sec emission) saw 7.8 billion KAS mined - representing 27% of total supply and $410M at current prices. However, ALL transaction records from this period are permanently missing from the blockchain. No full node worldwide has complete transaction history from genesis. This creates a $410M evidence gap where fair distribution cannot be verified.",
    
    "evidence": [
      "CRITICAL: Missing blockchain data - all transactions from Nov 7, 2021 to May 8, 2022 permanently unavailable. 7.8B KAS (27% of supply) mined during this period with zero verifiable transaction records.",
      "Network restart undisclosed: Major bug at day 14 (Nov 22, 2021) caused network fragmentation. ~648M KAS mined before halt. Genesis block manually created from checkpoint. Incident not disclosed in subsequent announcements; revealed only in 2024 Twitter exchange with Ergo founder.",
      "Delayed public announcements: Discord-only launch (Nov 7), network restart (Nov 22), then BitcoinTalk announcement (Nov 26) - 19 days after launch, 4 days after restart. Public mining community had 19-day information disadvantage.",
      "Undisclosed VC funding at launch: $8M Polychain Capital investment received pre-launch but not mentioned in initial announcements. Team presented project as 'hobby' and 'community-driven' despite institutional backing.",
      "Bitmain VP on team: Gadi Glickberg (former VP of Bitmain) joined DAGLabs 7 months before launch (April 2021). Represents unprecedented hardware expertise and potential access to mining infrastructure.",
      "20-month GPU moat: First ASIC (IceRiver KS1/KS2) not released until March 2023, 16 months after launch. During this period, organized entities with $8M capital and GPU procurement access held advantages vs. retail miners.",
      "Early hashrate anomalies: Network grew from 60 MH/s (Nov 13) to 2 GH/s (Nov 27) to 4 TH/s (Jan 2022) to 500 TH/s (Nov 2022) - 8,333x growth in 6 months. While not proof of insider mining, pattern consistent with rented infrastructure deployment.",
      "Pre-launch philosophy discouraged full nodes: Founder's May 2021 blog post (6 months before launch) prioritized 'issuance and decentralization' over 'historical transaction validity.' This positioned missing data as potentially acceptable by design.",
      "Developer suppression of questions: Community member investigating missing Feb 2022 transaction was kicked from Discord and question deleted. Later dismissed as 'nothing burger' despite technical details proving data gaps.",
      "Attack feasibility admitted: Developer Michael Sutton initially denied hijacking attack was possible; later acknowledged mechanism was technically feasible. Shai Deshe (co-founder) admitted attack could occur without full nodes.",
      "Victim reports of missing coins: Multiple users reported coins vanishing without outgoing transactions during Nov 2021 - May 2022 period. E.g., 'BinaryStyles' reported 25,000 KAS disappeared from wallet with no transaction record.",
      "Solo mining incidents: Protocol allowed single miners to receive 100M+ KAS in periods with network issues, creating concentration opportunities during early chaotic phase.",
      "DAGLabs mining was confirmed but unverifiable: Team disclosed 700-850M KAS mined over ~5 months (Nov 2021 - May 2022). No on-chain verification possible due to missing transaction data. Impossible to confirm distribution to Polychain, employees, advisors as claimed."
