    "CRITICAL: First 6 months of blockchain history (Nov 2021 - May 2022) permanently missing - 7.8 billion KAS (27% of supply, $410M current value) cannot be verified as fairly distributed",
    "No technical pre-mine (0 KAS allocated before genesis), but substantial structural insider advantages during early GPU mining phase",
    "DAGLabs was dissolved shortly after mainnet launch in November 2021 per official sources; Polychain Capital and Polychain have waived intellectual property rights. Kaspa is now a community-run project.",
    "Network restart at day 14 (Nov 22, 2021) resulted in loss/reset of ~648M KAS mined in first 14 days; incident undisclosed for years (only revealed in 2024 Twitter exchange)",
    "Ex-VP of Bitmain (Gadi Glickberg) joined DAGLabs 7 months before launch - represented unprecedented hardware expertise and potential access to manufacturing capacity",
    "BitcoinTalk announcement delayed 19 days after launch and 7 days after network restart - public mining community had delayed visibility compared to informed insiders",
    "20-month GPU-only mining period (Nov 2021 - July 2023) before ASIC availability allowed organized entities with capital and hardware expertise to prepare mining operations",
    "Developer transparency failures: Questioned investigator was kicked from Discord and question deleted; missing data acknowledged only when confronted with technical analysis",
    "Forensic team admitted hijacking attack was technically feasible without full nodes - attack vector would allow theft during missing data period (Nov 2021 - May 2022)",
    "Multiple user reports of missing coins (disappearing without visible outgoing transactions) during the missing blockchain data period; claims unverified due to data gap",
    "Mining profitability at $0.0591/KAS: ASIC miners at cost of $0.038/KAS showing healthy 55% margin at $0.10/kWh electricity. Negative margins only above $0.12/kWh.",
    "Pool decentralization significantly improved: Oct 2025 top 5 pools = 78% combined (f2pool 23%, viabtc 22%, humpool 21%, whalepool 6%, k1pool 6%) vs. Dec 2021 peak of 74% in single pool (Poolflare)",
    "Kaspa blockchain continues autonomous operation with active community development. No central authority extraction post-DAGLabs dissolution."
