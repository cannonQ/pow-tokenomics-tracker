# INSTRUCTIONS:
# 1. This template is for block reward emissions (not traditional time-locked vesting)
# 2. Use this when tokens are emitted via consensus mechanism over time (like treasury emissions)
# 3. Replace YYYY-MM-DD with actual dates (genesis_date + month offset)
# 4. Replace bucket names with exact names from genesis.json allocation_tiers
# 5. emission_pct_of_bucket is relative to that bucket's total allocation
# 6. cumulative_pct_of_bucket should reach 100.00 at final emission month
# 7. Delete this header section before running csv_to_emission_json.py
