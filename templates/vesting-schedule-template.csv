# INSTRUCTIONS:
# 1. Replace YYYY-MM-DD with actual dates (genesis_date + month offset)
# 2. Replace bucket names with exact names from genesis.json allocation_tiers
# 3. Include one row per bucket per month (if tier has 0 buckets, skip that tier)
# 4. Extend to 60 months by default (add/remove rows as needed)
# 5. unlock_pct_of_bucket is relative to that bucket's total allocation
# 6. cumulative_pct_of_bucket should reach 100.00 at final vest month
# 7. Delete this header section before running csv_to_vesting_json.py
